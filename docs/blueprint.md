# **App Name**: RoleSync

## Core Features:

- Role Synchronization: On user login, synchronize roles on Discord servers.
- Role Display: Display the assigned roles for each user in a clear and organized manner.
- AI Role Suggestion: Employ an AI tool to suggest appropriate roles based on user activity or profiles, but only when configured by the admin of the Discord server.
- Admin Panel: Admin Panel where a discord admin user can define rules for new users to gain roles on the server, based on various configurable settings. This page uses React Hook Form for handling and validation of the settings.
- User Report: Generate reports of all synced users.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Purple (#8f3f71) to align with the visual style.
- Secondary color: Blue (#076678) to complement the primary color.
- Background color: Dark gray/Black (#282828) for a modern and sleek interface.
- Font: 'Inter', a sans-serif font, for a modern, machined look, suitable for UI headlines or body text
- Use clean, line-based icons for roles, permissions, and settings.
- A tab-based navigation will provide the primary organization for pages/views. The dashboard should focus on displaying role sync details.
- Subtle transitions and animations for user interactions.
